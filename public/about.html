<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Amaan Ras Petersen, 
  and I'm a software engineering student at Wethinkcode College in Woodstock. Currently, 
  I'm enrolled in the Full Stack Web Developer Course offered by The App Brewery. 
  This website serves as a part of my coursework, where I get to showcase my skills and creativity in web development.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it offers. Web development, in particular, 
  has captured my attention with its ability to create dynamic and interactive experiences for users.
  Exploring the world of web3 and its potential is something I find especially intriguing</p>

<p>Besides my passion for web development, 
  I have a keen interest in fashion, film, photography,
   skating, and cinema. I enjoy expressing my creativity 
   through various mediums and finding inspiration in different art forms. Whether it's designing a visually appealing website or capturing captivating photographs, 
  I strive to bring my creative side to everything I do.</p>

<p>In my free time, you'll often find me sipping a cup of tea and indulging in desserts. I find solace in these simple pleasures that add a touch of sweetness to life. Additionally, I've recently developed an interest in surfing, a thrilling sport that allows me to connect with nature and ride the waves.</p>

<p>This website holds a special place for me as it marks my first-ever website creation. Hosting it on GitHub and making it accessible to the world is an exciting step in my journey as a web developer. I may be new to this field, but I'm eager to learn, grow, and refine my skills along the way.</p>
